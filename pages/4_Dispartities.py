    #### Understanding These Disparities
    
    It's important to note that these disparities do not suggest inherent differences in parenting practices
    across racial or ethnic groups. Rather, they reflect:
    
    - **Historical and ongoing inequities** in access to resources and opportunities
    - **Socioeconomic factors** such as poverty, housing instability, and lack of access to healthcare
    - **Reporting biases** including potential over-scrutiny of certain communities
    - **Systemic and structural factors** that affect family stability and well-being
    
    Research consistently shows that when controlling for socioeconomic factors, racial
    disparities in maltreatment rates are significantly reduced.

    #### Why Young Children Are at Higher Risk
    
    The data clearly shows that younger children, particularly infants under one year old,
    experience maltreatment at significantly higher rates than older children. This vulnerability
    stems from several factors:
    
    - **Complete dependency** on caregivers for all basic needs
    - **Inability to report abuse** or seek help
    - **Developmental vulnerability** to injury
    - **Caregiver stress** associated with caring for infants and young children

    This simplified representation illustrates an important concept: risk factors for child maltreatment
    rarely occur in isolation and often have a multiplicative rather than merely additive effect.
    
    For example, poverty alone increases risk, but when combined with social isolation or substance
    abuse, the risk increases disproportionately. This understanding helps in designing more
    effective, comprehensive prevention and intervention strategies.

    st.markdown("""
    ### Data Sources
    
    The disparities data presented in this dashboard is aggregated from several sources:
    
    - **Primary Source**: U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Children's Bureau
    - National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS)
    - Census Bureau population estimates for demographic context
    - Research literature on risk factors and their interactions
    
    ### Methodology Notes
    
    - **Rate Calculations**: Victimization rates are calculated as the number of victims per 1,000 children in each specific population group
    - **Data Limitations**: Some demographic data may be incomplete in case reports
    - **Intersectional Analysis**: The intersectional analysis presented is a simplified representation based on research literature, as comprehensive intersectional data is limited
    - **Causal Interpretation**: Disparities should not be interpreted as causal or deterministic; they reflect complex societal factors
