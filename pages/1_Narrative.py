Child maltreatment affects thousands of lives each year in the United States. 
While official reports show some improvement over time, the impact on the most vulnerableâ€”especially infantsâ€”remains profound.

In this narrative exploration, we'll walk you through the data to reveal the human side of the numbers, 
explain the challenges, and highlight why continued effort and prevention are essential.

        Child maltreatment includes all types of abuse and neglect of a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role.
        
        The four common types of maltreatment include:
        - **Physical abuse**: Physical acts that caused or could have caused physical injury
        - **Sexual abuse**: Involving a child in sexual acts
        - **Emotional abuse**: Behaviors that harm a child's self-worth or emotional well-being

        3. Received a disposition (finding)
