        ### Missed Opportunities for Intervention

        and intervened, but didn't. These include:
        
        - Teachers noticing behavioral changes or physical signs
        - Healthcare providers seeing injuries or concerning symptoms
        - Neighbors aware of concerning situations but unsure how to respond
        - Family members who suspected something was wrong

        ### The Importance of One Caring Adult
        
        A consistent theme in survivor stories is the profound impact that even one supportive
        adult can have. This might be:
        
        - A teacher who provided a safe space at school
        - A coach who offered consistency and positive attention
        - A relative who eventually intervened
        - A counselor who validated their experiences
